## 1. Salifort Motors HR Project

This project involved analyzing a dataset and building predictive models to provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. The primary objective was to predict whether an employee will leave the company, using either a regression model or a machine learning model.

## 2. TikTok Project

This project involves leveraging data science skills to develop a machine learning model aimed at classifying TikTok videos. The objective is to determine whether a video contains a "claim" or offers an "opinion." Creating an effective prediction model will help TikTok reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. Ultimately, this effort will contribute to mitigating the spread of misinformation on the platform, enhancing the overall quality and trustworthiness of the content.

## 3. Waze Project

This project involved utilizing data science techniques to develop a machine learning model aimed at predicting user churn. A project proposal was completed, Waze's user data was explored and analyzed, data visualizations were created, and a hypothesis test was conducted. Additionally, a binomial logistic regression model based on multiple variables was built.

Leadership valued these efforts and sought a more advanced machine learning model to predict user churn. To achieve the best results, two tree-based models were built and tested: Random Forest and XGBoost. This work empowered leadership to make informed business decisions that prevent user churn, improve user retention, and drive Waze's growth.

## 4. Yellow Taxi Trip Automation Project

This project involved utilizing data science techniques to develop a machine learning model aimed at predicting if a customer will not leave a tip. The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) requested this model to be integrated into an app that alerts taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, as drivers rely heavily on tips.

A structured notebook guided the completion of this project, which involved answering specific questions and performing various tasks.
